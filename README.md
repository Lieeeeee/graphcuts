Graph cuts segmentation with kernel shape priors (ImageJ/FIJI plugin)

This method is based on the method in the paper

Joshua C. Chang, and Tom Chou. Iterative graph cuts for image segmentation with a nonlinear statistical shape prior , Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision, 2013, DOI:10.1007/s10851-013-0440-9.

Initial commit doesn't have method for annealed relaxation.
